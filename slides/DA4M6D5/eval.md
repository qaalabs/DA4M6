## Course Evaluation

- Make sure to allocate 10 minutes for learners to complete the Live event evaluation
- Evaluation link should have been sent to learners, ask if it has not been.

If you don't leave positive feedback (if you only give a 7 or below), it would be great if you could tell us how we can improve

- 10 :D
- 9 :)
- 8 :~
- 1-7 :(

Please take your time completing feedback - we DO read it! ~ Thank you!
